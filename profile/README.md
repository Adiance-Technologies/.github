## What We Build

Adiance’s software stack is designed around a core CCTV camera product, extended by intelligent systems that enhance security, observability, and operational efficiency.

### 🎥 Camera & Embedded Systems

* Firmware and low-level software for camera SoCs
* Hardware abstraction layers, drivers, and system services
* Performance, reliability, and security-focused embedded code

### 🧠 AI / ML & Computer Vision Platforms

* Real-time and batch **computer vision analytics** for video streams
* Object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis
* AI pipelines optimized for edge and server-side inference
* **LLM-based event summarization** to convert raw video events into human-readable insights for faster monitoring and decision-making

### 🖥️ Streaming & Surveillance Infrastructure

* Video ingestion, processing, and streaming services
* Secure, scalable pipelines for live and recorded footage
* Integration between camera hardware and analytics platforms

### 🏢 Enterprise & Internal Platforms

Supporting systems that manage devices, data, and operations at scale:

* **VMS** – Video Management Systems
* **EMS** – Enterprise Management Systems
* **TMS** – Task Management Systems
* **ERP** – Enterprise Resource Planning
* **CMS** – Customer Management Syatem

These platforms enable deployment, monitoring, analytics consumption, and lifecycle management across large camera fleets.

## Repository Structure & Ownership

This GitHub organization hosts:

* Production-grade services and libraries
* Research and experimental AI/ML projects
* Firmware and hardware-adjacent codebases
* Internal tools and shared infrastructure components

Each repository is expected to include:

* Clear documentation and setup instructions
* Defined ownership and contribution guidelines
* Security and compliance considerations where applicable

---

## Purpose of This Organization

The Adiance GitHub organization exists to:

* Act as a **single, centralized workspace** for all Adiance engineering efforts
* Encourage reuse, consistency, and collaboration across teams
* Provide long-term maintainability and traceability of codebases
* Scale seamlessly as new products, platforms, and technologies are introduced

All new Adiance software projects—whether embedded, AI-driven, or enterprise-facing—should be hosted under this organization unless explicitly exempted.

---

## Contribution & Access

Access to repositories is managed based on team and project requirements.
Contribution guidelines, coding standards, and CI/CD practices are defined at the repository level.

For questions regarding access, ownership, or architectural direction, refer to internal documentation or contact the relevant project maintainers.
